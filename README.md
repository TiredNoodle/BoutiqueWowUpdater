# BoutiqueWowUpdater / Tired Launcher

Couldn't find a launcher that was suitable for my needs, so I decided to slap together my own!

Current Features:
* Can use the launcher from anywhere, as long as you can set the path to game directory, where Wow.exe is located (It finds the ".exe" in the game folder automatically, and relative to it, finds realmlist.wtf aswell as Data folder);
* Automatically checks for newer versions of the launcher (latest release from github repository), and can update it pretty much on the fly;
* You can save realms to switch around in the 'realmlist' file, by pressing on a menu option called 'Realms', and from there 'Manage';
* In 'Preferences', you can toggle the 'Check for Updates on Startup', to disable/enable update check on startup of the launcher;
* The changes you make in the launcher are saved in a 'config.ini' file for convenience. It is generated automatically when the launcher is being used.
